# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time learning about passportjs and angular-ui router, then looking over the code to become more familiar with where everything is and what has been done or has yet to be completed.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to contributing to this project, I can already see I will learn a lot from this.

### Day 2: August 4, 2016

**Today's Progress:** 

**Thoughts:** Today was a struggle to get this done, as family is in town and still taking care of a 3 week old baby. However I got it in even though I didn't finish what I was adding to the project. More angular and work to be done on the Booking pages tomorrow...

### Day 3: August 6, 2016

**Today's Progress:** The project I'm working on with some other developers had the code base file structure refactored today, so I spent some time debugging things and making sure my part worked correctly. Then I added some more functionality to the AngularJS I had been writing before the refactor. Things are coming along well, and I plan on expanding on the functionality of the feature. We don't yet have any content to put into this, but at least I can get it all working functionally speaking.

**Thoughts:** I had to miss yesterday because family was still in town and my baby was being particularly needy and cranky. Today I got back on track. Regarding the work, the more I use Angular, the more I like it and the intricacies makes sense. This is exciting, because I've used Angular for some time now, but never really had the chance to explore it in depth like I am now...and I like it!

### Day 4: August 7, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Adding browserify to the project along with gulp so we don't have so many files linked in the index.html

**Thoughts:** I've got to figure out a better time of day to do this...not getting much sleep and coding late is slow going...

### Day 5: August 8, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Found out the hard way browserify is not as easy when on an Angular project, so switched to gulp concat instead. Now testing.

**Thoughts:** Tired, not enough sleep, but sticking with it.

### Day 6: August 9, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Very productive day. Got gulp concat, gulp watch and gulp uglify working!

**Thoughts:** Today was very educational. I feel like I understand gulp a lot more and I have to say I'm very proud of myself for working out all the bugs and getting this to work successfully!

### Day 7: August 10, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time researching for a photography website I'm building for my daughter to post her portfolio.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it's not all about typing code in a text editor...

### Day 8: August 12, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Added some more gulp tasks to the Impakt CMS project, setting up watch and browsersync. Slimmed down some code in the controller I'm working on and started the skeletal framework for the functionality it will need since I'm still waiting on the client side facing stuff.

**Thoughts:** Also joined in on a start up that may be funded this fall or winter on equity. We'll see how it goes, but I like the idea of the project and the people I'll be working with.
