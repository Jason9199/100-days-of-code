# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time learning about passportjs and angular-ui router, then looking over the code to become more familiar with where everything is and what has been done or has yet to be completed.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to contributing to this project, I can already see I will learn a lot from this.

### Day 2: August 4, 2016

**Today's Progress:** 

**Thoughts:** Today was a struggle to get this done, as family is in town and still taking care of a 3 week old baby. However I got it in even though I didn't finish what I was adding to the project. More angular and work to be done on the Booking pages tomorrow...
