# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time learning about passportjs and angular-ui router, then looking over the code to become more familiar with where everything is and what has been done or has yet to be completed.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to contributing to this project, I can already see I will learn a lot from this.
