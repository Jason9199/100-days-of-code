# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 3, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Spent some time learning about passportjs and angular-ui router, then looking over the code to become more familiar with where everything is and what has been done or has yet to be completed.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to contributing to this project, I can already see I will learn a lot from this.

### Day 2: August 4, 2016

**Today's Progress:** 

**Thoughts:** Today was a struggle to get this done, as family is in town and still taking care of a 3 week old baby. However I got it in even though I didn't finish what I was adding to the project. More angular and work to be done on the Booking pages tomorrow...

### Day 3: August 6, 2016

**Today's Progress:** The project I'm working on with some other developers had the code base file structure refactored today, so I spent some time debugging things and making sure my part worked correctly. Then I added some more functionality to the AngularJS I had been writing before the refactor. Things are coming along well, and I plan on expanding on the functionality of the feature. We don't yet have any content to put into this, but at least I can get it all working functionally speaking.

**Thoughts:** I had to miss yesterday because family was still in town and my baby was being particularly needy and cranky. Today I got back on track. Regarding the work, the more I use Angular, the more I like it and the intricacies makes sense. This is exciting, because I've used Angular for some time now, but never really had the chance to explore it in depth like I am now...and I like it!
